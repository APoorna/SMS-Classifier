# SMS-Classifier

This Project is all about rectifying spam SMS.

📱 Building a Spam Detection Model for SMS Classification using Python 

🛠️Excited to share my recent project where I developed a text classification model to differentiate between spam and non-spam (ham) SMS messages using data science techniques in Python.

🔍 Dataset: Leveraging the SMS Spam Collection dataset, I preprocessed the text data by tokenizing, lowercasing, lemmatizing, and removing stopwords.

📊 Feature Extraction: Employed TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform text data into numerical features, capturing the significance of words in messages.

⚙️ Model Training: Utilized Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The model was trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics.

📈 Results: Achieved an impressive accuracy rate, providing a solid foundation for identifying spam messages efficiently.

🚀 Exciting to explore how Python can combat spam messages effectively in today's communication landscape!
